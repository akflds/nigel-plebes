# Nigel Plebes

A word guessing game, inspired by the [New York Times' Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee).

Find as many words as you can with the 9 letters on screen. If you find the 9 letter word, you win the round!

This app was built using React. You can play it here: [https://nigel-plebes.netlify.app/](https://nigel-plebes.netlify.app/)

Note: I'm currently using a limited word list. Please don't take it personally if it doesn't recognise one of your guesses. I'm working on a more robust back-end with a lot more words!

## Who is Nigel Plebes?
